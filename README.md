# ðŸ‘‘ N-Queens
A visualisation tool written in Python (using Pygame) to solve the famous N-Queens problem.

## Problem
The N Queen is the problem of placing N non-attacking chess queens on an NÃ—N chessboard so that no two queens attack each other. 
Solutions exist for all natural numbers other than n=2 and n=3.


## Psuedocode
```
while there are untried configurations
{
   generate the next configuration
   if queens don't attack in this configuration then
   {
      print this configuration;
   }
}
```
